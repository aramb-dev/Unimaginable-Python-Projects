I would like to (verb) animals as a veterinarian when I grow up. I would make sure
the (animal) and (animal) who came to see me were (adjective). Some veterinarians
care for small animals, like (animal) and (animal), and others (verb) larger ones, 
like (animal) and (animal). I'm not sure how easy it would be to give a (adjective) (animal) medicine!
The best part about being a veterinarian would be (verb-ing) the animals feel (adjective).
